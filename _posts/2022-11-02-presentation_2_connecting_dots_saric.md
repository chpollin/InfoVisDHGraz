## Summary

The work of Sanja Sarić focuses on using networks to visualize topic modeling results in order to show the closeness between entities and the inclusion of further annotated data from the corpus. The network graphs were created in Gephi, and the nodes were colored based on calculated modularity. She found that the network visualizations were insightful and compelling because they were able to demonstrate otherwise invisible relations. However, it is noted that the complexity of the visualizations presents a challenge for researchers unfamiliar with the method. The aim of the presentation was to follow-up with a discussion about the use of networks in combination with topic modeling and ways to improve their comprehensibility in the research community.
