## Summary

Ventsislav IKOFF, Alessio CARDILLO, Laura FÓLICA, and Diana Roig SANZ present a methodology of displaying literary translation within periodicals published in Ibero-America during the first half of the 20th century. The research focuses on the heterogeneity of the authors, literatures, and languages that were translated, in order to explore how foreign literature circulated during the modernism and avant-garde periods. The presenters propose a “composite visualisation” comprising a dynamic geographical visualisation using Nodegoat and a nested Sankey diagram, both representing the same data. A focus is laid on the metadata for each contribution, including the author's country of origin or nationality, the place where the magazine was published, and the original language. Different techniques are employed to visualize the relationships between languages, magazines, and the authors' country of origin as a weighted network embedded into space. They reflect how different visualisations can influence and determine the perspective taken on the data.
