## Summary

Korbinian GRÜNWALD’s project is focused on the study of the social structure of Vienna in the mid-15th century, a time of escalating Habsburg succession conflicts. The legal transactions documented in the municipal land registers are used to create a relational database using the methods of digital humanities, and subsequently analysed using prosopographical and social network analysis methods. The resulting data is then utilised to construct and evaluate social groups and networks, and to investigate the correlations between communities of property, group affiliations, and relationships. The aim is to create an interactive map for visualization to show the relations between places, institutions, and people.
