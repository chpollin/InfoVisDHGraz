## Summary 

According to Keith Andrews, information visualization is the practice of turning abstract information structures into visual representations, often with accompanying interactions, to make the information easier to understand and analyze. He divides the field of visualization into sub-fields, that is, Information Visualization (InfoVis), Geographic Visualization (GeoVis), and Scientific Visualization (SciVis), with Data Visualization being the combination of InfoVis and GeoVis. Visual Analytics adds analysis to the visualization process. As such, visualization can be used to explore and analyze data, as well as to present results and insights to a wider audience. He emphasizes that accessibility for visualization is (still) often lacking.
