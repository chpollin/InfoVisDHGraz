Vienna City Library

# Abstract 

The Vienna City Library (Wienbibliothek im Rathaus) is a special library with a general
focus on the urban and cultural history of Vienna. For more than 160 years, it has
collected, preserved and made accessible the estates of famous Viennese people in the
fields of culture, science and politics as well as posters, magazines and books focussing on
Vienna. Its extensive holdings, information services and exhibitions make it a place of
academic research, a meeting place for authors and a space for discourse for all those
interested in Vienna's history.

All in all the manuscript collection holds about 250,000 catalogued autographs as well as
about 1.060 estates. Estate materials are of a very diverse nature – manuscripts of works,
correspondences, life documents, objects etc. – and thus the indexing of the materials can
be inconsistent despite the rules and regulations "Resource Indexing with Standard Data
in Archives and Libraries (RNAB)”as a new version of the RNA (see

https://www.siwiarchiv.de/online-nachlasserschliessung-in-archiven-und-bibliotheken-
ein-regelwerk/). Especially the different depth of indexing (fully catalogued, partially

catalogued, pre-sorted) makes a computer-aided structured evaluation of the estate
holdings almost impossible.
All estates are recorded in the library catalogue and thus can be searched and found
there. That sounds easier than it actually is.
The library catalogue is a search tool that requires a certain amount of prior knowledge in
order to find what one is looking for. It is not a suitable tool for getting an overview of our
estate holdings. However, all estates are additionally listed in alphabetical order and by
collection (autographs collection / music collection). These lists are published on three
different web pages –which is hardly satisfactory.
The aimed visualisation does not intend to replace the library catalogue as a research tool.
We want it to offer an alternative entry point to our estate holdings and to stimulate new
perspectives on and engagement with the rich materials we hold. Ideally, VisPer appeals
to researchers with concrete research questions as well as interested laypersons in a
discovery mood. The goal is to encourage people to use and explore our unique holdings
and to inspire innovative research and participation on a large scale. In order to achieve
that, we need to make the meta-information available to our users in as diverse and
intuitive ways as possible – and that means offering more than just a name on a list.
Based on a visualisation of a thematic clustering in different fields of interest – which are
becoming more and more differentiated and also show the international network of the "memory of the city" – these person-centred papers collections will be made comprehensible, communicable and researchable in a completely different way.

In order to be able to offer different visualisations, the available data must be pre-
processed. The data is fed on two sources: the above-mentioned alphabetical lists and the

Vienna History Wiki, a semantic media wiki. The prosopographic enrichment of the data
will take place continuously by experts.
Within the scope of its possibilities, the Vienna City Library conducts research on its
holdings. Primarily, however, it sees itself as an enabler for research on the materials it
preserves. Anticipate future research questions is a challenge that the library faces
amongst others by applying high prosopographic metadata standards –based on current
best practices.

While our estates usually are centred on one person, they contain valuable information
also on others. We are particularly interested in the connections between people and their
affiliations according to various criteria, which is why we are supplementing the existing
indexing data with relevant information to enable evaluation and subsequent visualisation.
An example: on the basis of preserved life documents such as passports, proofs of
citizenship and correspondence, a journey into exile can be traced that is not recorded
anywhere according to the rules of indexing. If, for example, several people went to
Hollywood in a specific period, they would be represented in the visualisation in such a
way that this correlation becomes visible. However, we can only assume that the people
knew each other and had a relation to each other, but we cannot actually prove it - that
would be the task of further research. Therefore, the visualisation evokes a commonality
that is only assumed.

A question for visualisation experts would be how to distinguish confirmed information as
opposed to assumptions in visualisation? In addition, how do we deal with labels that are
used for structuring but are problematic in terms of political correctness. For example, the
differentiation of the origin or milieu from which a person comes could be labelled – and
while such labelling with "Jewish cultural background","Christian parental home" or
"aristocracy" is extremely useful to encourage differentiated research on a certain milieu
and its’ relation to others it is at the same time extremely problematic as cultural studies
frequently demonstrate.

A special feature of the attribution of affiliation are the “Vienna circles”, a concept by
Edward Timms which he used to describe loose networks in which progressive, modern
ideas emerged. In addition to the famousphilosophical "Vienna Cirlce" around Moritz
Schlick Timms located other networks around central persons. In their dynamics and
diversity, these "Vienna Circles" are difficult to grasp, especially since their interactions
often were informal and thus remained undocumented. Timms nevertheless attempted to sketchily capture these circles in order to show how ideas and persons were connected.1 To dynamically visualise these Viennese circles was the impetus for this project.

Data on the following categories for different visualisations and filter possibilities are kept:
* Language knowledge
* Milieu/Cultural Origin
* Religious affiliation
* Profession/Occupation
* Subject(e.g. music, politics, literature, art)
* Education
  * Kind of education
  * Educational institutions
  * Fields of education
* Historical classification (e.g. Biedermeier, Habsburg Monarchy, World War I, Interwar
period, etc.)
  * Further historical specification (eg. 1848s, Exile, Women’s rights activist,
Resistance)
* Affiliations to loose, not institutional networks like Vienna Circles
* Geo information about
  * places and countries of exiled persons
  * places of main activity

We are still in the conceptual designphase of the project and do not yet have a workflow
let alone any visualisation. We are still looking for partners with whom we will realise the
project.

The dataset will initially contain data on approx. 1.000 persons, their names and authority
file id numbers. Of these, approx. 100 names have the historical specification "exile",
approx. 10 data sets are quite complete with information on the above categories
(language knowledge, education...). For now the data is collected in an excel spreadsheet,
which will be transformed to a) one xml file for each person and b) to JSON data as a
starting point for different visualisations.
