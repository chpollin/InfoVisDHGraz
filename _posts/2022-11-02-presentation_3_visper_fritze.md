**Christiane Fritze, Katharina Prager and Evelyne Luef**\
Vienna City Library

## Summary

Christiane FRITZE, Katharina, PRAGER and Evelyne LUEF present a case on the Vienna City Library’s digital collection of materials related to the urban and cultural history of Vienna. Its holdings include manuscripts, correspondences, life documents, and other items. The library has a catalogue of its holdings but is working on a visualisation tool-chain (diagrams, plots, networks, maps) to make it easier for researchers to access and explore the collection. The application that her team is developing is expected to be especially useful for researchers with specific research questions or for lay people interested in discovering the library's holdings. It will allow users to filter and explore the collection based on different criteria, such as affiliation, education, language spoken, and time period. Aspects of uncertainty and vagueness in data are also addressed.
