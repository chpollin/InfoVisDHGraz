## Summary

Tiziana Alocci outlines that data stories are narratives that connect events, often tailored to the audience and influenced by design decisions. Data stories can include non-numerical data such as images, words, and sounds, as well as multimodal data like videos. Given her background, much of the work in creating data stories is research, rather than visualization itself, and the process can be broken down into four phases: discovery, definition, design, and production. She stresses that zooming into and out of data can help to understand its complexity and context, and data reuse and access are also important considerations in creating data stories.
