## Summary

Rubén Rodríguez CASAÑ, Elisabet Carbó CATALAN and Diana ROIG-SANZ create a visualization using data from the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation's (IIIC) archive to analyze global intellectual cooperation. The authors use different techniques of language processing and data science to reconstruct a co-occurrence network of cities and personalities. The visualization shows which areas of the world were more active in the network of intellectual cooperation, confirming the alleged Eurocentrism of the IIIC. However, other cities, such as Caracas and Bogotá, stand out due to their role as a bridge between Europe and South America. The authors discuss challenges they faced in preprocessing the data and in choosing between types of visualizations.
