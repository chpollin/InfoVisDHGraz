## Summary 

As per Linda Freyberg, information visualization is a melting pot of various disciplines and fields, including human-computer interaction, semiotics, and information design. The field is characterized by its interactive, abstract, and visual nature, which amplifies cognition and allows for the use of iconic and symbolic conventions to show relations and contextualize data. She highlights methods such as diagrammatic reasoning and data modelling as examples of visually understanding data.
