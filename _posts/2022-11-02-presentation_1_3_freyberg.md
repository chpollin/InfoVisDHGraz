## Summary 

As per Linda Freyberg, information visualization is a melting pot of various disciplines and fields, including human-computer interaction, semiotics, and information design. An important focus of her work is on the iconic dimension of knowledge organization systems and the epistemic potential of iconicity in the realm of digital cultural objects. The field is characterized by its interactive, abstract, and visual nature, which amplifies cognition and allows for the use of iconic and symbolic conventions to show relations and contextualize data. She highlights methods such as diagrammatic reasoning and data modeling as examples of visually understanding data.
