## Summary

The past 20 years have seen several initiatives to organize the knowledge collected in translation studies. These initiatives include bibliographies, encyclopedias, and handbooks. However, they do not focus on the development of a systematic view on collaboration within the discipline, but rather synchronically and diachronically. Against this backdrop, Luc VAN DOORSLAER plans to use bibliographical data to chart translation studies networks based on co-authoring and affiliations: putting institutions at the centre, not works as objects. By understanding translation as social practice, he attempts to use these data to visualize collaboration in the discipline and contribute to a more dynamic view on translation studies historiography. His role is understood as conceptually deciding what should be conveyed through visuals, not implementing them.
