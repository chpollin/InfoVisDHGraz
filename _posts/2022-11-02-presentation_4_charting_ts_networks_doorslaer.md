# Abstract 

The past two decades have seen a number of initiatives towards structuring the
knowledge collected in translation studies (TS) – bibliographies, encyclopedias,
handbooks, etc. However, the existing initiatives do not focus on the development of a
systematic view on institutional and individual collaboration in the discipline – both
synchronically and diachronically. Partly related to Hofeneder’s (2021) methodology for
analyzing and visually representing translation spaces, we intend to use the available
bibliographical data to chart TS networks based on co-authoring and affiliations. Those
data are included in the online Translation Studies Bibliography (Gambier and van
Doorslaer). Individual and institutional connections present in academic publication
partly reflect, but also co-determine the distribution and circulation of ideas and
approaches in the discipline.

Up to now we only have a few limited visualizations of co-authoring networks for a
small test case developed with Nodegoat. My participation in the workshop is aimed at
receiving feedback and possible alternatives for the data visualization. Co-authoring
data, particularly when connected with a diachronic approach, will express more
dynamic relationships on collaboration, for instance about institutionalization of
knowledge development through universities and research groups. As such, the aim is
also to contribute to a dynamic view on TS historiography.
