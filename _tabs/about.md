## Workshop on Information Visualization in the (Digital) Humanities

### 27th-28th of October 2022, University of Graz 

Organizers: Philipp Hofeneder (Department of Translation Studies),\
Christopher Pollin (Centre for Information Modelling)

Information visualization has become an integral part of the (digital) humanities and has undergone a rapid development during the last years. One of the advantages of this development is that the collection, analysis, and visualization of information take place no longer in separate processes, but are often undertaken by one and the same person or research group. This has drawn new attention to the usefulness and functionality in general and raises the question of the relationship between researchers and the objects of study. On the one hand, visualizations can provide useful insights and new perspectives. On the other hand, their applicability can be limited by the researcherâ€™s scientific aims, academic education, and their technical capabilities. A conscious approach allows us to uncover the advantages and disadvantages of these relationships between the object of study and the researcher.

The Centre for Information Modelling in cooperation with the Department of Translation Studies at the University of Graz organized a workshop to discuss this relation between researchers and the objects they visualize based on real use cases. Starting from an increased awareness of the relation between agent and object, we want to reflect on the researcher's point of view and how it practically influences the way we develop new visuals. Are they based on the information and its characteristic traits or rather on the needs of its further use? How do researchers influence their own visualizations and are they aware of their subjective approach?

To answer these questions, a jury of internationally recognised experts was formed for the workshop, which was subject the submitted examples to a structural analysis and combine it with a corresponding discussion. The participants of the jury deliberately cover different areas (technical, academic, artistic) and thus enable a well-founded analysis of the effectiveness.
